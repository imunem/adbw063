	<h2>Isa Munem</h2>
	<p>I am currently a Computer Science student at City UoL 
	   and wish to become a Software Engineer after completing my degree. 
	   I have briefly programmed using Python 
	   and have created some small projects 
	   as can be seen on my <a href="https://github.com/imunem">GitHub Page</a> </p>

	<h2>Bootcamp 2020: COVID-19 Data Visualisation</h2>
	<p>My first programming project created during the 2 week Coding Bootcamp at City. This Processing project illustrates understanding of loops, arrays and data handling. I created a bar graph using a csv file that I imported into my code; depicting daily UK COVID-19 cases from 31/01/2020 - 13/03/2020 with the dates postioned along the left-side of the sketch and appropiately sized bars which are colour-coded. The changes in length of bars allows for trends to be formed from the data. </p>
